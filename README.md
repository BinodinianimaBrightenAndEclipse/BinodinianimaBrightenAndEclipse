Established in the year 1988, "Paritosh Dey and Sons HUF" laid the foundation of our company's distinguished history. However, the year 1990 marked a pivotal moment in our journey, when a catastrophic fire incident not only claimed our business but also led to the tragic loss of lives and properties within the vicinity.

In the aftermath of this profound adversity, a period of contemplation and restoration ensued. Emerging from this crucible of challenges, BINODINIANIMA BRIGHTEN AND ECLIPSE PRIVATE LIMITED emerged as the successor, specifically designed to serve the informational and educational domains. With a steadfast dedication to the dissemination of knowledge, we stand as a testament to resilience, embodying a commitment to the collective progress and enlightenment of society.

With a dedicated team of experts, we specialize in ghostwriting, logo design, letterhead creation, website developer and visiting card creation.
